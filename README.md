## Basic Concepts

**What is Kubernetes?**  
*Answer:* Google developed Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating deploying, scaling, and managing application containers. It simplifies container management through a powerful ecosystem of tools and APIs.

**What are Pods in Kubernetes?**  
*Answer:* Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They represent one or more containers running together on a single node and sharing the same IP address and storage.

**What is a Node in Kubernetes?**  
*Answer:* Nodes are worker machines in Kubernetes (either virtual or physical) that host services to run Pods. The master Node manages them.

**What is a Cluster in Kubernetes?**  
*Answer:* A cluster is a collection of nodes managed by the Kubernetes Master Node, which orchestrates workloads, maintains desired states, and monitors health.

**Explain the Kubernetes Master Node’s role.**  
*Answer:* The Master Node manages the cluster, including the API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, and etcd. It orchestrates workloads, maintains the desired state, and is the primary communication point for users and applications interacting with the cluster.

## Controllers and Schedulers

**What is a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of identical Pod replicas are running at all times, allowing for horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

**What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* A Deployment is a Kubernetes object that manages the lifecycle of ReplicaSets and Pods. It allows for rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling, making it easier to maintain application versions.

**How does the Kubernetes Scheduler work?**
*Answer:* The Scheduler assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource requirements, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and taints/tolerations, optimizing resource allocation across the cluster.

**What are DaemonSets?**
*Answer:* DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a specific Pod runs on all (or some) Nodes, commonly used for monitoring or logging applications like Prometheus or Fluentd.

**What is the use of StatefulSets?**
*Answer:* StatefulSets manage stateful applications with unique Pod identities and persistent storage. They are ideal for databases or applications where each instance needs a consistent identity.

## Networking
**What is the Kubernetes Service?**
*Answer:* A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and access policies, exposing applications internally within a cluster or externally to outside users.

**How does Kubernetes handle service discovery?**
*Answer:* Kubernetes offers DNS-based service discovery, where each Service has a DNS name and environment variables for Pods configured with Service details.

**What are Ingress Controllers in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Ingress Controllers manage external access to services, supporting HTTP/HTTPS routing, load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

**Explain the concept of Cluster IP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.**
	•	*Cluster IP:* Exposes a service only within the cluster.
	•	*NodePort:* Exposes a service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
	•	*LoadBalancer:* Uses a cloud provider’s load balancer to expose services externally.

**What are Network Policies?**
*Answer:* Network Policies control traffic between Pods, allowing or denying connections based on labels, namespaces, and IP blocks for enhanced security.

## Storage and Persistence
**What is PersistentVolume (PV)?**
*Answer:* PV is a storage resource in Kubernetes that exists independently of any Pod, providing durable storage for stateful applications across cluster restarts.

**What is PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?**
*Answer:* PVC is a storage request made by a pod. It dynamically provisioned storage for applications and linked Pods to Persistent Volumes.

**Explain Storage Classes in Kubernetes.**
*Answer:* Storage Classes enable dynamic storage provisioning based on predefined storage types and quality offered by cloud providers or local storage options.

**What is the difference between emptyDir and hostPath?**
*Answer:*
	•	emptyDir: Provides temporary storage within a Pod.
	•	hostPath: Mounts a directory from the host node’s filesystem, providing shared or persistent storage across restarts.

**How does Kubernetes manage storage with StatefulSets?**
*Answer:* StatefulSets provides each Pod a unique volume based on its identity, ensuring persistent storage even when Pods are rescheduled.

---
## Advanced Concepts
**What are ConfigMaps?**
*Answer:* ConfigMaps stores non-confidential configuration data, such as environment variables, in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables or mounted volumes.

**What are the Secrets in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Secrets store sensitive information like passwords or tokens in an encoded format, which can be used as environment variables or mounted as files within Pods.

**Explain Helm in Kubernetes.**
*Answer:* Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies complex applications' deployment, management, and versioning using charts.

**What are Operators in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Operators extend Kubernetes by managing applications and configurations automating tasks such as backup, scaling, and failover for stateful applications.

**What is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD)?**
*Answer:* CRDs allow users to define custom objects in Kubernetes, enabling the Kubernetes API to manage custom resources and extend the ecosystem.

---
## Security
**What is RBAC in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to Kubernetes resources by defining roles and role bindings, enabling granular permission control across clusters.

**What are network policies used in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Network Policies manage ingress and egress rules between Pods and external sources, enhancing security by allowing administrators to control traffic.

**How are Kubernetes Secrets secured?**
*Answer:* Kubernetes Secrets are base64-encoded, and encryption at rest can be configured for additional security. Access is controlled through RBAC.

**Explain Pod Security Policies.**
*Answer:* Pod Security Policies enforce security restrictions on Pods, such as running as non-root, read-only root filesystems, and volume access controls.

**What is an Admission Controller in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Admission Controllers intercept API requests, enforce policies, modify objects before they persist in etcd, and support security, compliance, and operational control.

---
## Troubleshooting
**How do you troubleshoot a Pod stuck in the Pending state?**
*Answer:* Check for resource constraints on the cluster, ensure no scheduling conflicts are caused by taints/tolerations, and verify node availability. Inspect the events related to the Pod using kubectl describe pod <pod-name>.

**What does CrashLoopBackOff mean, and how do you resolve it?**
*Answer:* CrashLoopBackOff indicates a Pod is repeatedly crashing. To resolve it, inspect the logs using kubectl logs <pod-name>, review the Pod’s configuration for errors, check health probes, and environment variables, and verify the container image is functional.

**How do you debug a failing Deployment?**
*Answer:* Verify Deployment events using kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>, check the status of associated ReplicaSets and Pods, inspect Pod logs for errors, and confirm resource allocations and configuration details.

**What tools can you use to monitor Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and visualization, the ELK Stack for log aggregation, and the Kubernetes Dashboard for real-time cluster insights are popular tools for monitoring Kubernetes.

**Explain the purpose of kubectl describe and kubectl logs.**
*Answer:*
	•	kubectl describe: Provides detailed information about a Kubernetes resource, including events, status, and associated configurations.
	•	kubectl logs: Retrieves logs from containers in a Pod, helpful for debugging runtime issues.

## Cluster Administration
**How can you scale a Kubernetes cluster?**
*Answer:* Use Cluster Autoscaler to add or remove nodes based on workload demands for dynamic scaling. Alternatively, add nodes manually through your cloud provider’s console or using tools like kubeadm.

**What is etcd in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* etcd is a distributed key-value store that holds all cluster data, including configuration, metadata, and the desired cluster state. It ensures high availability and consistency.

**How can you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster?**
*Answer:* For self-managed clusters, use kubeadm upgrade to upgrade control plane components and worker nodes. For managed clusters, rely on cloud provider tools like AWS EKS or GKE to ensure incremental updates.

**What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?**
*Answer:* HPA scales the number of Pods in a Deployment, Replica Set, or Stateful Set based on observed CPU, memory, or custom metrics to maintain application performance under varying loads.

**Explain Kubernetes Federation.**
*Answer:* Kubernetes Federation allows managing multiple clusters as a single entity, enabling cross-cluster workload distribution, improved high availability, and disaster recovery across regions.

## Best Practices
**How do you implement CI/CD with Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Use CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Argo CD to automate build, test, and deployment workflows. Employ Kubernetes-native tools like Helm for packaging and Kustomize for configuration management.

**Why are namespaces used in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Namespaces provide logical isolation within a cluster, enabling resource organization by teams or applications. They also help enforce access control policies through RBAC.

**What is a Blue-Green deployment in Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* Blue-Green deployments maintain two environments (Blue and Green), where traffic is routed to one while the other is updated. Once verified, traffic switches to the updated environment, minimizing downtime.

**What is Canary Deployment?**
*Answer:* Canary Deployment releases new features to a small subset of users in a controlled manner. It allows testing in production with minimal risk before a full rollout.

**How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes?**
*Answer:* To manage sensitive information, use secure tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets. Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest, and access is controlled using RBAC.

**Explain Kubernetes Horizontal and Vertical Scaling.**
	•	*Horizontal Scaling:* Increases the number of Pod replicas to handle higher traffic or workloads. Achieved by adjusting the replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
	•	*Vertical Scaling* increases the CPU and memory resources allocated to an individual Pod. It is suitable for workloads that require more computational power without adding instances.

**What is the kubectl port-forward command used for?**
*Answer:* The kubectl port-forward command forwards traffic from a local port to a port on a Pod within the cluster. It is often used for debugging or accessing applications that are not exposed publicly.

**How does the Kubernetes API server authenticate requests?**
*Answer:*
	•	*Methods:* Client certificates, bearer tokens, OIDC tokens, webhook authentication, and basic authentication.
	•	*Process:* After authentication, the request undergoes RBAC authorization and admission control checks before processing.

**What is a Job and a CronJob in Kubernetes?**
	•	*Job:* Manages short-lived tasks or batch processes. It creates Pods and ensures that a specified number of completions are achieved.
	•	*CronJob:* This tool Schedules Jobs to run periodically based on a cron expression. It is commonly used for tasks like backups or report generation.

**What is the difference between ReplicaSet and ReplicationController?**
	•	*ReplicaSet:* The modern controller offers set-based selectors for flexible Pod matching. It is typically used with Deployments for advanced functionality like rolling updates.
	•	*ReplicationController:* This is the older controller with equality-based selectors. It is less flexible and has largely been replaced by ReplicaSets.
